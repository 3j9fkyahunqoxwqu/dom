To generate Overview.html:

Ensure you have anolis <https://bitbucket.org/ms2ger/anolis> installed.

  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ms2ger/specification-data data
  $ make

When pushing commits, make sure you update both dvcs.w3.org and bitbucket.  For
instance, edit .hg/hgrc to contain something like

  [paths]
  default = https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore
  bitbucket = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ms2ger/dom-core

and then do

  $ hg push; hg push bitbucket

Obviously, you need to be authorized to push to both locations.
