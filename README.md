This repository hosts the [DOM Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `dom.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments" here (I
know). Also, the DOM Standard uses [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to generate
`dom.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need to
contain the generated HTML.)
